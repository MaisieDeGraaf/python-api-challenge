#WeatherPy Readme

----------------------------------------------------------

##Description

WeatherPy is a Python script designed to generate random geographic coordinates and create a list of cities based on those coordinates. It then retrieves weather data for these cities using the OpenWeatherMap API, analyzes the relationships between various weather variables and latitude, and performs linear regression analysis to understand these relationships better.


##How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
  a. matplotlib
  b. pandas
  c. numpy
  d. requests
  e. scipy
  f. citipy

3. Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
   
4. Insert your API key into the api_keys.py file in the WeatherPy directory.

5. Run the WeatherPy.ipynb file using a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment.
 
6. The script will generate scatter plots showcasing relationships between weather variables and latitude, as well as perform linear regression analysis for these relationships.

   
##Features

1. Generates a list of random cities based on geographic coordinates.
  
2. Retrieves weather data for these cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
  
3. Creates scatter plots to visualize relationships between weather variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed) and latitude.
  
4. Performs linear regression analysis for each relationship to identify correlations.


##Dependencies

- matplotlib
  
- pandas
  
- numpy
  
- requests
  
- scipy
  
- citipy


##Credits

-OpenWeatherMap: API for providing weather data.
  
- Citipy library: for city identification based on coordinates.
  
-Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.




#VacationPy Readme

---------------------------------------------

##Description

VacationPy is a Python script designed to help users find ideal vacation spots based on weather conditions. It utilizes weather data from a previous dataset generated by WeatherPy, filters cities based on user-defined weather preferences, and locates nearby hotels using the Geoapify API. The script then creates a map visualizing these potential vacation spots and hotels.

##How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
  a. hvplot
  b. pandas  
  c. requests

3. Get an API key from Geoapify.

4. Insert your API key into the api_keys.py file in the VacationPy directory.

5. Run the VacationPy.ipynb file using a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment. The script will:
   
 - Load weather data from the cities.csv file generated by WeatherPy.

 - Display a map with cities plotted based on humidity levels.

 - Filter the cities based on user-defined weather preferences (temperature, wind speed, cloudiness).

 - Locate nearby hotels for these filtered cities using the Geoapify API.
 
 - Display a map with potential vacation spots and hotel information.


##Features

1. Utilizes weather data generated by WeatherPy to find suitable vacation spots.

2. Filters cities based on user-defined weather preferences.

3. Uses Geoapify API to locate nearby hotels for potential vacation spots.

4. Generates an interactive map displaying vacation spots and hotel information.


##Dependencies

- hvplot

- pandas

- requests

##Credits

- Geoapify API for providing hotel data and location services.

- Pandas, hvplot, and requests libraries for data handling and visualization.
